#### [Teaching programming language concepts with F#](http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/peter-sestoft)

  Peter Sestoft, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark
  
  This is a two-part video lecture by Peter Sestoft, professor from the IT University of Copenhagen, 
  Denmark. In the lecture, Peter introduces the curriculum, lecture plan and lecture notes 
  for the course "Programs as data" that uses the functional programming concepts in F# to 
  teach students language concepts and implemen­tation details.

#### [Functional Programming Using F#](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~mire/FSharpBook)

Michael R. Hansen and Hans Rischel

This introduction to the principles of functional programming using F# 
shows how to apply theoretical concepts to produce succinct and elegant 
programs. Coverage includes advanced features in the .NET library, the 
imperative features of F# and topics such as sequences, computation 
expressions and asynchronous computations. The book contains a broad 
spectrum of examples and exercises. 

Further material comprising the programs in the book, lecture slides and 
mini-projects are found [on the book web site](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~mire/FSharpBook/).

#### [Programming Language Concepts](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Concepts-Undergraduate-Computer/dp/1447141555)

Peter Sestoft  

Programming Language Concepts uses a functional programming language (F#) as the metalanguage in which to 
present all concepts and examples, and thus has an operational flavour, enabling practical experiments 
and exercises. It includes basic concepts such as abstract syntax, interpretation, stack machines, 
compilation, type checking, and garbage collection techniques, as well as the more advanced topics on 
polymorphic types, type inference using unification, co- and contravariant types, continuations, and 
backwards code generation with on-the-fly peephole optimization. 

Programming Language Concepts covers practical construction of lexers and parsers, but not regular 
expressions, automata and grammars, which are well covered elsewhere. It throws light on the design 
and technology of Java and C# to strengthen students’ understanding of these widely used languages. 
The examples present several interpreters and compilers for toy languages, including a compiler for 
a small but usable subset of C, several abstract machines, a garbage collector, and ML-style polymorphic 
type inference. Each chapter has exercises based on such examples.

* **[Introduction to functional programming](http://tomasp.net/academic/materials/mff-fsharp-09/)**
  Tomas Petricek, Charles University, Czech Republic

  The course explains basic functional concepts such as function composition, functional data 
  types and higher-order functions. It highlights some interesting connections between these 
  and concepts that student may already know or will learn in various mathematics lectures. The 
  site includes lecture slides and a number of simple homeworks that usually require some 
  interesting insight.


* **[Functional Programming with F#](http://www.idt.mdh.se/kurser/DVA229/)**
  Björn Lisper, Mälardalen University, Sweden

  The course gives the students a solid under­standing of functional programming, its appli­cations, 
  and its strengths and weaknesses. It includes topics such as recursion, modern type systems, 
  higher order functions, lazy evaluation and tradeoffs of using side effects. In addition it 
  also provides short orientations of lambda calculus and type inference, in order to enhance 
  the understanding of the functional prog­ramming paradigm.

* **[Programming Paradigms](http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3242/)**
  Rowan Davies, The University of Western Australia

  This unit explores and compares the main alternative paradigms for high-level programming. It 
  considers important modern paradigms such as functional programming, logic programming and concurrent 
  programming, and compares these with the mainstream paradigms of imperative programming and 
  object-oriented programming. It considers past and future trends in programming paradigms and 
  explores the motivation for each paradigm, the concepts which define it, and how each paradigm can 
  be used in practice to complete programming tasks. It also compares the advantages of each 
  paradigm in the software production process, with particular emphasis on productivity, 
  scalability, program behaviour, and the correctness of programs. The unit focuses on both 
  fundamental concepts and practical software development, with the former enabling the latter. 

* **Functional programming at St Matthews**
  Samin Ishtiaq, Microsoft Research Cambridge

  Samin Ishtiaq taught a 1 hour crash course in functional programming to 10/11 year olds at 
  a local primary school. The course leads up to calculating areas and volumes, which is what 
  the students were learning in maths at that time. This was the first experience of programming 
  for almost all of the students.
