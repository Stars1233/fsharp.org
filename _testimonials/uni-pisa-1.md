At the University of Pisa we use F# for teaching UI programming, a fundamental course in the third year curriculum.
In 2014 two more courses (Programming I & II) will use F# and Try F#.

We use F# for teaching because it fits teaching both fundamentals and technology thanks to rich programming
environment and libraries to access all system resources (such as UIs). Moreover, F# feels like a dynamic
language thanks to F# interactive even if it is a statically typed language.  Our students use F# on Windows,
Mac and Linux. Try F# is a particularly valuable tool for teaching because it has a quite sophisticated
editor with interactive evaluation and the ability of sharing saved files with students.

Iâ€™ve also used F# for teaching programming for scientists at Scuola Normale Superiore, a PhD
course at ITU Copenhagen and to graduate students in biomedical engineering.

We recommend teaching F# because it is an extraordinary and flexible tool for teaching different areas of
Computer Science. The language is rich and its functional nature allows to easily define the appropriate
subset for teaching particular concepts. I use it to teach entire classes by typing code and evaluate interactively
discussing the results of a single evaluation. It is also a great tool for teaching programming to scientists
and engineers: I found that its mathematical roots in lambda calculus are more readily grasped by
non-programmers, and interactive evaluation recalls environments such as Matlab and Mathematica very
popular in these communities.
