The site amancai.com.au was built combining F#, Domain-Driven Desing, Asp.Net MVC and Azure. F# was an excellent choice as it allowed us to keep the code lean and very functional while having full access to the BCL, Azure and third party libraries.

Using F# Type Providers also helped us to improve our productivity and find problems early during the development process.

I personally enjoyed the experience of building the entire system using F#, I believe its "functional-first" approach is excellent for building a wide range of applications.
