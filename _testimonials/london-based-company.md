We have set up a complete risk management system that combines several data sources, presents them in a ...
WPF user interface, and does a LOT of calculation behind the scenes. When the calculation
requires a proper algorithm (i.e. anything that is more complex than a simple for loop),
our choice has been F#. I have to say I keep being surprised by how compact it is and, nonetheless,
how readable it is even when I'm reading code that I hadn't looked at or thought about for six months.
