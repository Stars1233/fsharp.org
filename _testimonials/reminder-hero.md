All of our back-end data processing and parsing is done in F#. The power and flexibility of the
language lets us ship features faster, with fewer bugs. Regressions are virtually nonexistent, and the
functional nature of the language makes it easy to ensure that our code is testable.

Our first iterations were written in C#, but after switching to F#, we saw a drastic reduction in code size,
along with an increase in readability. We'll definitely be sticking with F# for all of our future projects.
