I lead the Biological Computation group at Microsoft Research, where we are developing methods and
software for [modelling and analysis of biological systems](http://research.microsoft.com/biology).
We have been using F# in our group for the past 7 years, and it's the language of choice for all
of our software development. In particular it forms the basis of our software for programming
[computational circuits made of DNA](http://research.microsoft.com/dna), for programming
[genetic devices that operate inside cells](http://research.microsoft.com/gec), and for programming
[complex biological processes in a modular way](http://research.microsoft.com/spim).

The functional data structures and static type-checking that F# provides are ideally suited for developing
these domain-specific languages, and the Visual Studio integration is superb for debugging
and source control. The integration with .Net is seamless, and allows us to incorporate
efficient numerical and visualisation libraries written in C#. It also allows us to
take advantage of the full suite of .Net UI components.

Our languages are specified with a formal syntax and semantics, which are rigorously
analysed prior to their implementation. Programming in a functional language like F# brings the implementation much closer to the
formal specification, which is important for ensuring accurate simulation and
probabilistic analysis. Correct implementation of the semantics is critical, since even
small coding errors can give rise to divergent predictions, which can in turn compromise
biological experiments. F# is a great language for writing clean, concise code, which is
statically typed within a professional development environment that supports a wealth of
libraries. It will continue to be our language of choice for scientific computing.
