Since I started programming, I tested a lot of languages. I used PHP, JavaScript, C#, Elm, Lua, etc. And now I am using F# for all my projects. Since I discovered F# I've just found the language that I searched for so long as it has a lot of possibilities.

The tooling for the language is great and also this language is really supported by is community and I love that.

And finally, F# is a language with which I've become really efficient and I find that if I write a code the type inference assures me correctness. I am still waiting for the first bug to appear in my production app.
