I am involved in bioinformatics and computational genomics as a faculty member at the
University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).  In an academic medical center like UNMC there
are heavy demands on my time and a wide range of different types of research projects that
I can end up working on.  I have used the F# programming language
for several of these projects, including one that involved a very productive
collaboration with IntelliFactory and the use of WebSharper.  
You can visit the resulting [web site](http://app1.unmc.edu/fgx) and read the freely
available peer-reviewed scientific publication that describes the important
[infectious disease research](http://mbio.asm.org/content/4/1/e00537-12.long)
that this F# software development project facilitates.  I am always interested in
opportunities to work with professional software development enterprises whose teams include
developers with F# expertise, because I believe that many attributes of the F# programming
language make it an ideal choice for the development of software solutions that integrate
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and the exponentially growing volumes of molecular analysis
data that can now be obtained from individual patients (e.g., personal genome DNA sequencing data).

There's an exciting future for F# in this huge, emerging, data-rich health care market.
