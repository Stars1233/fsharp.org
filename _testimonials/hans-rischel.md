quote: Solving a number of programming problems using the language convinced me of the supreme qualities of F#
---
I was approached by my former colleague Michael (Michael R. Hansen) in autumn
2010 where he proposed that we should write a new textbook on functional
programming - now using the F# programming language. To begin with I was quite
sceptical about using a programming language appearing as part of a Microsoft
program package. Solving a number of programming problems using the language
convinced me, however, of the supreme qualities of F# - and we embarked on
the project of getting acquainted with F# and writing the textbook.

Michael and I spent considerable time solving traditional programming
problems in F#. A combination of functional and imperative F# with an
occasional pinch of OO gives a very pleasing platform for program
development - once you have found your way through the wilderness of MSDN
documentation (newcomers to the MSDN world may benefit from the
MSDN library documentation found on the [web-site of the book](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~mire/FSharpBook/index.html).
All of Chapter 10 and part of Chapter 11 present program examples using
this programming style.

Computation expressions look esoteric to begin with, but they are actually
rather useful. We spent much time
trying to get this concept down to earth, with the purpose of making it accessible
to simple-minded people like ourselves. The reader may judge how far we
succeeded by studying Chapter 12 of the book.

Writing this textbook with Michael has been an exciting experience.
