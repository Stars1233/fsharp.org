Bohdan Szymanik, CTO at Kiwibank, is keen to show how he's been using F# for analysis tasks
within the bank. He'll provide an intro to the language then show its use for performing
aggregations over large datasets, taking advantage of CPU and IO parallelism, and data
presentation through charting and image generation.
