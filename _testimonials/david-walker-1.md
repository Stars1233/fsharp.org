Our graduate course on Parallelism this Fall is full, even though it assumes no
experience with functional programming or F#. The students are preparing the courseware
themselves, and one of the topics we are studying is functional reactive programming (FRP)
with continuous, time-varying behaviors. F#, with its rich graphics libraries, made it
trivial to construct a super-fun assignment involving purely functional and interactive
animation of a mock solar system.
