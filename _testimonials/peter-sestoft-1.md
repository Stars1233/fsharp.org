F# has a beautiful, simple but expressive language at its core, and many powerful features
built around that core language.  It can draw on all the power of the .NET libraries,
and runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.  That's the reason we have chosen F# for our
undergraduate functional programming class as well as our
undergraduate programming language class [(link)](http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/plc/)
