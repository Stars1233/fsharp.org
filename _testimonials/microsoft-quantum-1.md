F# is central to Microsoft’s quantum algorithm research. The LIQUi|⟩ simulator (Language
Integrated Quantum Operations) presents an extension of F# that presents a
seamless integration of classical and quantum operations. The scale and efficiency
of the simulator allows it to handle among the largest entangled
systems of qubits (quantum bits) ever modeled utilizing a targeted linear algebra package
written entirely in F#. In addition, the modular architecture allows users to
easily extend the system in any desired research direction. The base library is
well over 20,000 lines of code and implements a wide range of modules including
circuits, molecular modeling, spin-glass systems, quantum error correction, machine
learning, factoring and many others. The system runs in client, server and cloud
environments. It is also designed to be used as an educational tool and we have
found that bringing new users up to speed is a quick and painless process.
