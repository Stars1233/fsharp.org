quote: On a release of a complex rules engine and data transformation system to one of our customers, we were delighted to hear that across 90+ markets, not one of them found any issues with any of the calculations in the datasets. F# just works.

As a consultancy geared towards delivering solutions to customers in a variety of sectors, we rely on F# for all of our solutions, whether it's a rules engine, a distributed and scalable data transformation system on Azure or a customer-facing web application. I love the fact that we have confidence in our deliverables thanks in no small part to the pit of success that F# leads us down; we very, very rarely encounted bugs that we saw time and again with other languages and frameworks. At the same time, we're able to consistently deliver to our customers much more quickly than we might have done otherwise - a key value proposition for many of our customers  who often need a short time to market.
