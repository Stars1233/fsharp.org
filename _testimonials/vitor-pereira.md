quote: I am using F# to develop an API for data encryption using fully homomorphic encryption.
---
I am currently using F# to develop my undergraduate final project. The project consists in developing
an Application Programming Interface that allows one to encrypt data using fully homomorphic encryption
and I found in F# the ideal programming language to develop it.

Besides all the benefits of the functional paradigm for this type of work, F# interoperability with
the .NET platform allows the construction of powerful implementations that other functional languages
do not allow so easily.

I really hope that, in the future, I keep working in Cryptography using F# as the main programming
language for my projects. I am also preparing a hands-on presentation about F# and Cryptography to
be presented at an event in Microsoft Portugal, which I will surely enjoy!
