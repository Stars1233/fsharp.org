A large financial services firm in Europe sought new development tools that could cut costs, boost productivity,
        and improve the quality of its mathematical models. To address its needs, the bank deployed F#, the
        .NET Framework, and Visual Studio. It will soon upgrade to Visual Studio 2010 and then integrated
        F#. With its new tools, the bank can speed development by 50 percent or more, improve quality, and reduce costs.
