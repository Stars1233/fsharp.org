The credit markets have varying pockets of liquidity. Market participants would like to understand how the
liquidity of their set of entities changes relative to the overall market. A liquidity scoring model is
needed to provide these metrics across the entire CDS universe. Functional programming and specifically
F# was used  in order to provide the market with a fast and accurate solution. ... The research and development cycle was made faster and more efficient by the effective use of
functional programming.

The efficient use of functional programming throughout the R&amp;D cycle helped make the cycle faster and more efficient.
Less time was spent on translating requirements, miscommunications etc and more on producing a fast and accurate solution quickly.

Since programmers can understand your quant code they can focus on their core competency â€“ developing fast and reliable production code.
The development exercise becomes catered towards optimization, performance tuning and error handling (i.e. making the code reliable)
Functionality is not lost from the prototype due to miscommunication or rather crude documentation/requirements, which saves time in testing.
Mass regression testing is easy with precise precision level differences between the prototype and the production system.
