F# has been the support/backbone of SynthGrid since the day we started. As a small team building a complex system, we needed a language that wouldn't let us shoot ourselves in the foot which is why F# is an amazing language to work with.

The type system allows us to deploy with extreme confidence and security. We've had virtually zero runtime type errors and null references in production because the compiler catches them all before code ever reaches production. When you're building broad agentic AI systems that need to run 24/7 without crashing, this isn't just something thats nice to have but it's also extremely essential.

Development speed is another huge win. What normally takes hundreds of lines in C# often takes significantly less in F#. It's fast, both in execution and development time.

Just use F#. Your future self will thank you from saving them hundreds of headaches.
