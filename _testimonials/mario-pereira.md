quote: Everyone gets really amazed when they try F# and experience its immense expressive power
---
I have been a Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) for three years, which
offered me the opportunity to be in touch with most portuguese
faculties and their students, getting the change to be a bit of an
evangelist for Microsoft technologies. I chose to spent my MSP
experience giving introductory seminars to F# and functional
programming using F#. So far, I have given these presentations on most
portuguese faculties and also at Microsoft portuguese headquarters. The
result is always the same: everyone gets really amazed when they try
F# and experience its immense expressive power, its delightful
syntax and realize they can do functional programming (which is
oftenly taken as something boring and complicated) on a familiar and
confortable environment. Currently, along with a fellow portuguese
MSP, (following the success of previous presentations and in response
to the many requests for new sessions on F#) I'm preparing an hands-on session on the use of F# for
Cryptography, to be presented on a future event at Microsoft Portugal.

Personally, F# offers me a solid and trustable ground to develop
reliable and complex applications on a confortable and succinct way,
impossible to achieve with other languages and paradigms. With no
doubt, I can say I'm a huge fan of F# and I'm always eager to get in
touch with every new feature the language has to offer.
