quote: When F# is combined with Visual Studio... productivity goes through the roof!
---
F# programs tend to be much shorter than their equivalents in other languages. The
fewer lines of code required, of course, the higher the productivity. When F# is combined
with Visual Studio, which provides help with remembering the methods attached to different
data types and how to use those methods, productivity goes through the roof!
