quote: F# encourages Reason Driven Development that leads to virtually bug-free code

We are using F# because it considerably increases speed of software development which is crucial
for a small company with limited development resources.  The most enjoyable feature of this language
is that the developer can reason about the code instead of relying only on unit tests.
I would say the language encourages Reason Driven Development methodology which leads to
virtually bug-free code.  F# as strongly typed functional language ideally fits for tasks our
software solves â€“ Fixed Income securities trading optimization. It is also very important that
F# computation engine could be seamlessly integrated with other parts of .NET-based software product.
