quote: At ClearTax, We have built a whole product from the ground-up in F#. It's been running in production for a couple of years â€” this has been a great experience for us.

The expressiveness and power of F# has resulted in shorter build cycles, simpler business logic (with fewer bugs!) and the ability to quickly evolve the product.

Type Providers have let us add support for a lot of data formats (Government formats, Excel files, third party sources) very quickly. Pattern matching has made it possible to simplify complex business logic. F# has been a joy to work with, and we're using it more and more throughout our products now.
