We develop security product to protect critical infrastructure (e.g. Oil Refinery, Airport, etc) for countries across
the globe.... In core of our product there are prediction algorithms. We use different modeling and theorems
(Monte Carlo, Action, etc) to implement the prediction components. ... Since we are rewriting our next generation product
using .NET, we have decided to use F# as functional language to  have automatic integration with rest of the system. ... We
also have advanced machine learning components (Artificial Intelligence) and functional languages are the
best fit to write AI stuff. We are planning to use F# as the primary programming language in this
area because of its interoperability with .NET.
