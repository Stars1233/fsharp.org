Covid-19 Tracker Slovenia is a community-driven open source project that collects, curates and publishes Covid-19 data for Slovenia. It was launched in March 2020 and server up to a million daily users.

We use F#/Fable/Feliz for front-end visualization, and F# has proven to be a very good choice for this fast-moving, decentralized project. The majority of people contributing code have never used a functional programming language or even heard of F#. Nevertheless, most contributors were able to quickly navigate the code and develop their own visualizations with little or no orientation and very few bugs or runtime issues.

By using F# and its strong type system, we were able to keep the code base consistent and easily adaptable to this ever-evolving and growing project. And the excellent Fable and Feliz projects allowed easy and smooth integration into the JavaScript ecosystem.
