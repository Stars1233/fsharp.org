In our internal engineering group at Microsoft, F# is used for several important tools:

* analyzing feedback on the web to look for compatibility-related issues,
* a static code analyzer to detect compatibility regressions in a product,
* a delta-debugging tool to help root cause regression analysis in product builds.
