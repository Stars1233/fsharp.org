TimeRocket is a service for attendance time tracking and absence- and shift-planning provided by Calitime AG.
The system runs on Azure, and we use F# on the ASP.NET backend and Azure Functions to program the business logic.
We like F# because discriminated unions, pattern matching, computation expressions and out-of-the-box equality allow us to keep the code simple even in complicated business cases.
