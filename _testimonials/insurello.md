At Insurello, F# lets us model complicated business data with a lightweight syntax in a way that feels closer to reality. The type system helps us avoid creating impossible states and enables us to focus on the business problems. The compiler and the use of exhaustive pattern matching have saved us from what could’ve been many mistakes in production. F# is “just the right amount of FP” which helps us write simple and maintainable code and makes it easy to onboard people, even those with no background in Functional Programming.
