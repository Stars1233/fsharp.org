As a business we actively seek improvement every single day. This is the same for our IT systems,
so we have been searching for a means to do that in our in-house software systems.

The F# type system has allowed us to do this - by eliminating null references, increasing type
safety and creating rich domain models that help us express hard-and-fast business rules in a
way that we can really lean on the compiler; while actually reducing our total lines of code
(and noise!). Doing so has reduced both our requirement for expensive bug hunts in our
production systems, and the overall cost of maintaining unnecessary code complexity.

We have been evaluating F# for a year now, and have components in our production systems that
have been bug-free since deployment. The results speak for themselves.
