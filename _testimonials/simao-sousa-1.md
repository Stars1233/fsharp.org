quote: F# is very popular among my students for the programming projects

I teach and use OCaml and F# in my lectures (Theory of Computation, Formal Languages and Compiler
Design, Formal Methods, Applied Cryptography), and F# is very popular among my students for the
programming projects.  Most of the students that are supervised by me (undergraduate, master
but also PhD) use F#  as the underlying programming language. This is even more the case now since
part of our research directions includes working on cloud/distributed systems.

F# and its programming environment  leverage with no doubt the ability and the productivity of my
students. This is, in my opinion,  for two main reasons. First, F# allows the student, but also the
researcher like me,  to focus on the key aspects of his creation, while, secondly,  enhancing  
technologically the work done in a so remarkable and facilitated way.  Once drawn in paper and pencil,
an algorithm is naturally implemented in F# and easily deployed in whatever is its execution context.

I am  definitively a strong believer of F# and amazed by the language and its community.
