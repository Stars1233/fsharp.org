quote: I have now delivered three business critical projects written in F#. I am still waiting for the first bug to come in.
---
I am both a C# dev and an F# dev. I can only offer subjective anecdotal evidence based
on my experience of delivering projects in both languages (I am too busy delivering
software to do anything else).

That said, the one stat in the summary that I find most compelling is the defect rate.
I have now delivered three business critical projects written in F#. I am still waiting
for the first bug to come in. This is not the case with the C# projects I have delivered.
I will continue to monitor and report on this. It might be that I am just on a lucky streak,
but I suspect that the clarity and concision of F# code contributes greatly to its correctness.
