F# was used on Microsoft's AdPredict project for adCenter. This was a 4 week project with 4 machine learning experts involving a model
with 100 million probabilistic variables and processing 6TB of training data in real-time. 2 weeks of CPU time
were used during training. Benefits included  **Quick Coding** - F#'s powerful type inference means less typing, more thinking,
**Agile Coding** - Type-inferred code is easily refactored,
**Scripting**  - "Hands-on" exploration,
**Performance** - Immediate scaling to massive data sets,
**Memory-Faithful** - Mega-data structures on 16GB machines,
**Succinctness** - Live in the domain, not the language,
**Symbolic** - Schema compilation and "Schedules" and **.NET Integration** - Especially Excel, SQL Server
