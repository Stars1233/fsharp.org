You can formulate many problems much easier, closer to their definition and more concise in a
functional programming language like F# and your code is less error-prone (immutability, more powerful type system, intuitive recurive algorithms).
You can code what you mean instead of what the computer wants you to say ;-)  Furthermore you
can have F# and C# together in one solution, so you can combine the benefits of both
languages and use them where they're needed.
