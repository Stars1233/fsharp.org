Historically, our code base has been written in a mix of C# and VB.net. F#'s excellent interoperability
with the rest of .NET allows us to use it for components where it's particular strength's shine without
having to discard or rewrite our existing code.

Whether it's driving the build and continuous integration system (due to scripting being a first
class citizen in the F# world) or writing rock solid infrastructure components (due to the easy
use of functional paradigms via features such as computational expressions, type inference and
discriminated unions) we have found our F# code to be concise, easy to write and reliable to use.
It is a perfect fit for many components within our messaging based architecture.

We would recommend it as an additional tool in the kit of any company building software on the .NET stack.
