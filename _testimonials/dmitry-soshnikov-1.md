I do some samples in F# for the lectures and the book, but all that is within a single-user
VS 2010 Pro installation. Right now we have a set of slides on functional programming with
F# in Russian in the curriculum repository, and the video-course of functional programming
using F# available in the largest Russian Internet-University (intuit.ru). The course
is being taught in 2 universities. There is a noticeable interest in the developer community in
Russia towards F#.
