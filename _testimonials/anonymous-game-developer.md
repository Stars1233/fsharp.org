quote: It's like 'Python with type inference' — but even better!

I'm gradually learning F#, and even though I haven't explored OOP or more advanced language features yet, I find it strikingly clearer than C#. It's like 'Python with type inference' — but even better!

When I first tried C#, I kept thinking: 'Why can't types be inferred automatically?' Dynamic languages like Python hid the types, but sacrificed the type safety that I loved about C#. F# finally gives me the best of both worlds: C#'s power without manual type annotations.

I'm still a beginner (no quizzes please—I'm soaking it in slowly!), but that rare 'this is exactly what I’ve been searching for' feeling? F# delivers that. Truly refreshing.
