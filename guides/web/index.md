headline: Guide - Web Programming with F#
---

F# excels at building efficient, scalable and robust web solutions. Web programming is
based around receiving a single HTTP request and replying with a result, which maps very
well to a stateless, functional approach. Advantages to using F# for web programming include:

* *Fast* - F# code execution is fast, using native code generation from scripted or project code

* *Succinct* - F# is concise, readable and type-safe, for fast development of robust web solutions

* *Reactive and Scalable* - F# asynchronous programming simplifies scalable, reactive web programming

* *Interoperable* - F# interoperates seamlessly with languages such as C#, JavaScript and TypeScript

* *JavaScript-ready* - F# is JavaScript-ready through [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) and [Fable](http://fable.io/)

* *Open-source* and *cross-platform*

![logo](../../images/thumbs/fable.png)&nbsp;[Fable](http://fable.io/) is an F# to JS compiler designed to generate clean
and standard code in order to maximize interoperability in both ways. It integrates with most
of JS development pipelines like [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
or [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/). Fable allows you to develop
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) services, desktop apps with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)
and mobile apps with [React native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Web Frameworks

<br />

#### Giraffe

{: #giraffe  .anchor }

![logo](../../images/thumbs/giraffe.png)&nbsp;[Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe) is an F# library for building rich web applications that use ASP.NET Core under the hood. It has been heavily inspired and is similar to [Suave](https://suave.io/), but has been specifically designed with [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core) in mind and can be plugged into the ASP.NET Core pipeline via [middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware).

* [Docs](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md)
* [Samples](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe/tree/master/samples)
* [Blog post showing how to use it with .NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/09/26/build-a-web-service-with-f-and-net-core-2-0/)

#### ASP.NET Core

{: #aspnetcore  .anchor }

[ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core) is a modern, cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications. It runs on .NET Core and supports F# out of the box. If you install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core), there are F# templates available via the `dotnet new` command.

#### Saturn

{: #saturn    .anchor }

![logo](../../images/thumbs/saturn.png)&nbsp;[Saturn](https://saturnframework.org) is a web development framework written in F# which implements the server-side MVC pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to anyone with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Pythonâ€™s Django. It's built on top of Giraffe and ASP.Net Core - modern, cross-platform, high-performance development platform for building cloud-ready web applications.

It's heavily inspired by Elixir's [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/).
