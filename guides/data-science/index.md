Data science is the application of statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization and programming to
real-world data sources to bring understanding and insight to data-oriented problem domains.
F# is an excellent solution for programmatic data science as it combines efficient execution,
REPL-scripting, powerful libraries and scalable data integration.

   package for data and time series manipulation and for scientific programming.
   It uses a design similar to the Pandas library from Python and the 'tseries' or 'zoo' packages in R, though
   with stronger typing. Deedle supports working with structured data frames, ordered and unordered data, as well as time series. Deedle is designed to
   work well for exploratory programming using F# and C# interactive console, but can be also used in

## Interoperability

### F# and Excel

{: #excel-interop .anchor }

[Excel-DNA](http://excel-dna.net/) is an independent project to integrate .NET into Excel. With Excel-DNA you can make native (.xll) add-ins for Excel using C#, Visual Basic.NET or F#, providing high-performance user-defined functions (UDFs), custom ribbon interfaces
and more. Your entire add-in can be packed into a single .xll file requiring no installation or registration:

* [Excel-DNA home pages](http://excel-dna.net/)
* [Async and event-streaming Excel UDFs with F#](https://excel-dna.net/blog/2013/03/26/async-and-event-streaming-excel-udfs-with-f)

[Sharp Cells](https://www.sharpcells.com/) is another independent project which integrates F# scripting with Excel. It exposes the scripts as either user-defined functions (UDFs) using [Excel's XLL API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/excel/welcome-to-the-excel-software-development-kit) or commands using [Excel's COM API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.office.interop.excel?view=excel-pia). Compilation takes place at runtime allowing rapid iteration of your code and the scripts are embedded with the workbook maintaining single-file portability similar to VBA.
