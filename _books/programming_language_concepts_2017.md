The book Programming Language Concepts (PLC) provides an introduction to programming language concepts and implementation technology, such as interpretation, compilation, type checking and type inference, abstract machines, and garbage collection. F# is used as a meta language throughout the book expressing all concepts and examples of programming language design in a modern strongly-typed language of the ML-family, enabling the reader to experiment with the ideas right away.
