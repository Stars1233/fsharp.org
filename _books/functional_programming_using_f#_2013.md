This comprehensive introduction to the principles of functional programming using F#
shows how to apply basic theoretical concepts to produce succinct and elegant programs.
It demonstrates the role of functional programming in a wide spectrum of applications
including databases and systems. Coverage also includes advanced features in the .NET
library, the imperative features of F# and topics such as text processing, sequences,
computation expressions and asynchronous computation. With a broad spectrum of examples
and exercises, the book is perfect for courses in functional programming and for self-study.
Enhancing its use as a text is an accompanying website with downloadable programs, lecture
slides, a mini-projects and links to further F# sources.
