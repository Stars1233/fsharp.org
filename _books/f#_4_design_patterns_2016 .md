In this book you will:

- Acquire the practical knowledge to use the main functional design patterns
- Realign some imperative and object-oriented principles under the functional approach
- Develop your confidence in building and combining first-order and higher-order functions
- Learn to use core language pattern matching effectively
- Make use of native F# algebraic data types in place of custom-built classes
- Recognize and measure the difference in resource consumption between sequences and materialized data collections
- Navigate and use F# Core libraries with ease by seeing patterns behind specific library functions
- Master writing generic polymorphic code
