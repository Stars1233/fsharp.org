Why just get by in F# when you can program in style. This book goes beyond syntax and into design. It provides F# developers with best practices, guidance, and advice to write beautiful, maintainable, and correct code. This second edition, fully updated for .NET 6 and F# 6, includes all new coverage of anonymous records, the task {} computation expression, and the relationship between types and modules.

_Stylish F# 6_ covers every design decision that a developer makes in constructing F# programs, helping you make the most educated and valuable design choices at every stage of code development. You will learn about the design of types and function signatures, the benefits of immutability, and the uses of partial function application. You will understand best practices for writing APIs to be used by F#, C#, and other languages. Each carefully vetted design choice is supported with compelling examples, illustrations, and rationales.
