### Option 2: Use Elmish.WPF (Windows Only)

Elmish.WPF is a production-ready library that allows you to write WPF apps with the robust, simple, well-known, and battle-tested MVU architecture, while still allowing you to use all your XAML knowledge and tooling to create UIs.

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF#getting-started-with-elmishwpf)

* [Tutorial](https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md)

### Option 3: Use Windows Forms or WPF directly (Windows Only)

On Windows, F# lets you directly program Windows Forms and WPF applications directly.  Some resources for doing this are below, many others
are available on the web.
