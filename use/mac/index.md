### Option 1: Install the CLI tools and use your own editor

![logo](../../images/thumbs/dotnet.png)&nbsp;Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Once that is installed, you can begin using F#!

Create a file called `hello.fsx` that looks like this:

```fsharp
printfn "Hello World from F#"
```

Now compile and run this F# script with the following command:

```
dotnet fsi hello.fsx
```

If this is your first time using .NET Core, there will be a short, one-time message about using the .NET SDK. After that, you'll see the following output in your console:

```
Hello World from F#
```

To create a project use

```
dotnet new console --language F#
dotnet run
```

You will see a message saying "Hello World from F#".

For more information see [Getting started with the F# command line tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-command-line).

### Option 2: Install Visual Studio Code and Ionide

![logo](../../images/thumbs/VSCode.png)&nbsp;[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a free, [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), cross platform source code editor
supporting [a lot of languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview).
F# is supported by the [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) project.

1. Install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) like in step 1.

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for macOS.

3. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` and enter the following to install the Ionide package for VS Code.

        ext install Ionide-fsharp

You can also install the plugin from the plugin pane on the left-hand side.

Ionide works best if you use the .NET CLI to create your projects. You can learn more in [Get Started with F# in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/get-started-vscode).

You can install [JetBrains Rider from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/).

You can build and contribute to the F# compiler and library from [the source](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp).
